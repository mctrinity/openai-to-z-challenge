## 📊 3. Methodology

### 🔍 Step 1: Define Area of Interest (AOI)
Describe and justify your chosen region.

### 🛰️ Step 2: Satellite / Elevation Analysis
- NDVI, elevation anomalies, canopy gaps
- Tools: Google Earth Engine, geemap, etc.

### 📜 Step 3: Textual Data Analysis (GPT-4.1)
- Geocode historical coordinates, identify place names
- Models used: GPT-4.1 / OpenAI o3/o4 mini

### 🔁 Step 4: Cross-Validation
- Evidence convergence: imagery + terrain + textual data

---

## 📍 4. Findings

- **Coordinates of Predicted Sites (Lat/Lon)**:
  - Site 1: `[-XX.XXXX, -XX.XXXX]`
  - Site 2: ...

- **Summary of Evidence:**
  - NDVI anomaly + historical map alignment + oral narrative

---

## 📐 5. Visuals

Include maps, overlays, and screenshots of:
- Sentinel-2 NDVI
- LIDAR / DEM elevation anomalies
- GPT-4.1 outputs with place name/coordinate matches

---

## 🧪 6. Reproducibility

Describe how others can reproduce your work:
- Link to notebook(s)
- Earth Engine script ID or repo
- Instructions to rerun analysis

---

## 💡 7. Historical Insight or Hypothesis

> What does your finding imply about past civilizations or Amazonian history?

---

## 🏁 8. Conclusion and Next Steps

- Summarize your site prediction(s)
- Suggest further field validation
- Discuss limitations and possible improvements

---

## 📚 9. References

- List all papers, lidar tile IDs, datasets, GPT prompts, etc.
